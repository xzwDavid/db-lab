## Hey Guys
Please use this as a reference instead of the ans to copy.......

## TO DO
1. run this program and finished the lab report  
2. I just implement the insert and selete transcation, I believe there are more stuff to do. Nevertheless, only this one transcation seems enough for this lab. Anyway, I will finish last transaction one day. (e.g. update.... select...)  

## How To Run this
1. clone this repo  
2. change the filepath and database setting in main accordingly.(note that you can just set the filepath to data in dataset in this repo)
3. run the main and see the stdout and database to validate your result :)
